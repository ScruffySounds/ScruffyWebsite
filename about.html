        Maxx Bradley is a media composer, video creator, and visual artist. His jazz piano studies and performances over 18 years in Charleston, South Carolina have uniquely sculpted his compositional style, both audially and visually. During his time at College of Charleston, he honed his craft under such accomplished musicians as Yiorgos Vassilandonakis, Quentin Baxter, and Robert Lewis. He also developed a love for video games and their soundtracks, particuarly the colorful styles and gameplay of Nintendo games. The <i>Pikmin</i> series will forever be his favorite.

        He now holds an MFA in Music Composition from the California Institute of the Arts, having worked under Michael Pisaro's mentorship and scored student films, video games, and collaborative Scruffy videos. He also produced his first concerts here: a videogame music concert in the spirit of fellow composer Ryan Yoshikami, and a personal recital of music celebrating the Scruffy tag: "What I Love."

        He aspires to keep producing educational content about video game design and audio, and to always keep making music of many kinds, in his own style and the ones he befriends. He ultimately hopes to make an eclectic music education accessible and enjoyable to anyone.
